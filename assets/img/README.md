3. Place it in this folder (`assets/img/lurk.png`)

### For lurk.mp3:
1. Create or download a short (1-3 second) audio file
2. Name it `lurk.mp3`

## Current Command Needs

Based on your `backend/config/commands.js`, you need:
- `lurk.png` (for !lurk command)
- `lurk.mp3` (for !lurk command)

The discord command only sends chat messages, so no assets needed for that one.
